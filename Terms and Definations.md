* `Class` - A new custom data type that defines attributes (member variables) and methods. This is like a blueprint to create instances or objects of that class. Example: A Person has given name and family name.

* `Instance` - A variable whose data type is the class. We often use the term Object interchangeably. Example: We can have two instances of the Person class: one for John, and one for Mary.

* `Instantiate` - A verb that means "to create an instance of." Example: We can instantiate the Person class to create a new object.

* `Method` - A member function. Methods are called using "dot notation" with an instance of the class before the dot. Example: person1.GetEasternName()
